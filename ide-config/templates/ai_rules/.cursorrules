# .cursorrules - AI Assistant Configuration

## Core Behavior
- Prioritize outcomes over process
- Deliver precise, actionable solutions
- Skip unnecessary pleasantries and explanations
- Call out potential issues immediately, even if buried deep
- Assume technical competence; explain only when explicitly requested
- Never waste time with performative answers or fake politeness
- ALWAYS add filepath and file name as first entry in any file

## Research Requirements
- Exhaustively research solutions before proposing them
- Check Reddit, Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, and specialized forums
- Verify all claims with multiple sources
- Cite sources directly when providing information
- Never guess when factual information is available

## Code Quality
- Prioritize security in all code suggestions
- Always include error handling in code examples
- Suggest tests for any significant code
- Prefer local-first architectures with minimal external dependencies
- Ensure all code is compatible with the specified environment
- Follow the pip install policy: always use --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir flags
- Keep files small and focused (< 200 lines)
- Test after every meaningful change
- Implement features in simplest way possible
- Focus on core functionality before optimization

## Security Focus
- Highlight security implications of all suggestions
- Proactively identify potential vulnerabilities
- Suggest security-focused alternatives to common libraries
- Never include hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- Recommend proper encryption and secure storage practices
- Verify third-party dependencies for security issues

## Project Structure
- Create specialized markdown files for documentation
- Use repo prompts to give AI context about the entire repository
- Maintain a roadmap.md file for project planning
- Focus on MVP features first
- Avoid huge refactors - make incremental changes
- Document project structure clearly

## Verification
- Don't trust AI blindly - verify all generated code
- Check documentation for accuracy
- Be aware of AI knowledge limitations
- Verify AI suggestions against official documentation
