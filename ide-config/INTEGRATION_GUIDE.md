# IDE Config GUI Integration Guide

This document provides instructions for integrating the Firebase GUI with the IDE-config repository data.

## Directory Structure

The integrated repository has the following structure:

```
IDE-config/
├── data/
│   ├── gui_ready_data.json    # Structured data from Grok research
│   └── vscode_settings.json   # Sample VS Code settings
├── gui/                       # Directory for your Firebase GUI files
│   └── README.md              # Integration instructions
├── scripts/                   # Original IDE-config scripts
├── docs/                      # Documentation
└── templates/                 # Templates for configuration
```

## Integration Steps

1. **Clone the repository locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/k3ss-official/IDE-config.git
   cd IDE-config
   ```

2. **Copy your Firebase GUI files**:
   Copy all files from your Firebase GUI project into the `gui/` directory, excluding:
   - `.git/` directory
   - `node_modules/` directory
   - `.next/` directory (build output)
   - `.env` file (create a new one with appropriate values)

3. **Connect the GUI to the data**:
   Update your components to import data from the data directory:
   ```typescript
   // Example usage in your components
   import data from '../../data/gui_ready_data.json';
   
   // Access extensions
   const extensions = data.categories.extensions;
   ```

4. **Install dependencies and run**:
   ```bash
   cd gui
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Data Structure

The `gui_ready_data.json` file contains all extracted recommendations organized into these categories:

- **Extensions**: Productivity, security, AI assistance, and essential extensions
- **Security Practices**: Best practices for secure development
- **AI Rules**: Rules for AI coding assistants (core behavior, research, code quality, security)
- **IDE Settings**: Recommended settings for VS Code and other IDEs
- **Templates**: Reference templates for projects and configurations

## Customization

You can modify the `gui_ready_data.json` file to add or remove recommendations based on your preferences. The structure is designed to be extensible and easy to update.

## Deployment

After integration, you can deploy the complete tool following the original IDE-config deployment instructions, with the GUI now providing a modern interface for configuration and setup.
